      -- basis, constructor, minimality

10-14 Structural Induction
      -- show that the property is preserved
         for each constructor

10-18 Proofs w Recursive Objects, RBTs
      -- structural induction...
      -- use contradiction to show every
          element (e.g., palindrome) is in the set

10-21 Sums, Asymptotics -- (e.g., maximum substring sum)
      -- categorizing runtimes, ideally using Big-Theta

10-25 Asymptotics, Divisibility, GCD,
      Euclid's Algorithm, Bezout's Identity

Problem 10.13(c)...

e.g., gcd(3,6)=3   m=3   n=6

       mx+ny=3   3x+6y=3   x+2y=1

            x=-1  y=1


       ax+by=1    -a+b=1

(remember that d is the GREATEST common divisor, so there
 is are smaller divisors, one of which is always 1)
