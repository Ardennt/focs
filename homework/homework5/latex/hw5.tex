    \noindent \textbf{*Problem 13.42: To determine if a graph G with 50 vertices is 3-colorable, you test all possible 3-colorings. Your computer checks a million 3-colorings per second. Estimate how long it is going to take, in the worst case.}
    \\ Test all 50 vertices with 3 colors:
    \\ By sum and product law, we know that the number of subsequent choices aren't affected by the previous, we can conclude that each vertices will have 3 possible choices. All possible 3-colorings are calculated by $3^{50}$
    \\ Given that the computer checks a million 3-colorings per second, we can calculate:
    \begin{align*}
        T &= \frac{3^{50}}{10^7}\\
        & \approx 7.179 \times 10^{16}
    \end{align*}
    \noindent This means that all possible 3 colorings can be calculated in about {\LARGE $\boxed{\mathbf{7.179 \times 10^{16}}}$} seconds.

    \\ For this problems, we can think of it as choosing 7 random number out of a bucket, each number is placed 7 times, so there is a possible of a single number being chosen
    7 times. We can think of it as this 10 containers and we have 7 items to place in 10 different containers. Since we have 10 different containers for the 7 items, we can select 
    k = 7 numbers from r = 10 containers. With this, we can derive the k-subset formula with repetition equal to $\dbinom{10 + 7 - 1}{10 - 1}$ = {\LARGE \boxed{\mathbf{\dbinom{16}{9}}}}

        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
            \item 5 or more consecutive 1's
            \\ For a string of 5 bits, we have 6 possible start locations to begin placing 1's to make 
            sure that we reach 5 consecutive 1's. For the remaining 5 numbers, we have 2 options, represented
            by:
            \begin{verbatim}
                { {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, x, x, x, x, x}
                x = dont care
            \end{verbatim}
            There are $6 \times 2^5$ choices for this subset. A double counting issue such as this arises:
            \begin{verbatim}
                { x {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, x, x, x, x}
            \end{verbatim}
            where this subset can produce the same string as the one above.\\
            Given that there are 5 different "dont cares", we can restrict each of them, leaving the other 4 free to have all the repeated, forming the equation $2^4 \times 5$\\
            Removing them from our original subset, we get $6 \times 2^5 - 5 \times 2^4$ = {\LARGE $\boxed{\mathbf{112}}$}
            \item 5 or more consecutive 0's
            \\ following the same logic, we can deduct this is the same, at {\LARGE $\boxed{\mathbf{112}}$}

        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{How many contain 5 or more consecutive 0’s or 5 or more consecutive 1’s?}
        For every binary string that have 5 or more consecutive 1's, just replace those with 0's
        to achieve $2 \times 112$ possibilities. There are two possibilities that are double
        counted: 1111100000 and 0000011111 = {\LARGE $\boxed{\mathbf{2 \times 112 - 2}}$}

        5. {{1, 2}, 3, 4, {5, 6}} subsequence 1,2 and 5,6 appear
        6. {1, {2, 3}, 4, {5, 6}} subsequence 2,3 and 5,6 appear

    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=7: ]
        \item Number that all sequences appear = $3!$
    \end{enumerate}
    We can get rid of subset 4-6 by subtracting, but for subset 7, since all sequences appear, we removed it before so we have to add it back.
